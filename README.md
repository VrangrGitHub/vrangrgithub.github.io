About me: 
        I went to Leland High School, in San Jose,California. I loved High School, largely because of my involvement with our drama program. I did Costumes, which meant that I spent 
        9+ hours a week sewing Costumes for our shows, it was incredible. My favorite show was Chicago, as there was tons to do and there was always so much energy from both the actors
        and the crew. Other than drama, I play a good amount of video games, mostly World of Warcraft, Dota 2, and Overwatch.
